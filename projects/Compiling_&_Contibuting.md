# Compiling and Running

## Datapacks

- Clone or download the repo,
- Run [zip_files.py](/projects/zip_files.py),
- there are a few options in the python file for you if you want certain things or not,
- The datapacks should then be made in the same folder as the .py file is.

## World Downloads

### Prism Launcher / MutliMC

- Make your way to your main instance's world tab
- Drop the world file onto the app from your file explorer (only tested on Prism)
- Load the game

### Offical Launcher

- Find your way to `~\Appdata\Roaming`
- Make sure you have the `Hidden Items` option checked in your file explorer
- Go into your `.minecraft`, and find the `saves` folder
- From there, drop the uncompressed world file into that folder, and launch Minecraft
